Finding Value
=============

Identify and strive for something you appreciate in each moment.

Don't get caught up in all the terrible things you have to wade through, but instead search for some gem of greatness that you can find excitement in and concentrate on that. We have experiences each moment and what we take away from each experience is our choice. The choice to find value in our experiences provides it's challenges but is much more rewarding than having a history of worthless experiences.

You can something plan ahead, choosing to do something hard and decide that you are going to work to learn from it, using the challenge as a catalyst to further growth. Other times you donâ€™t get to choose to do something hard, but when reacting and finding yourself in the middle of working through a difficult challenge, you can still choose to learn from the situation, and utilize what was forced upon you, meant for destruction, as a means of growth.
