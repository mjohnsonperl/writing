Finding Value

Identify and strive for something you appreciate in each moment.

Don't get caught up in all the terrible things you have to wade through, but instead search for some gem of greatness that you can find excitement in and concentrate on that. We have experiences each moment and what we take away from each experience is our choice. The choice to find value in our experiences provides it's challenges but is much more rewarding than having a history of worthless experiences.
